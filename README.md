Spotify Web API Routes
``` js
router.get("/search", (req, res) => {
    getAuth()
    .then(data => {
      const token = "Bearer " + data.access_token;
      let search_url = "https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?";
      
      let params = []
      for (let k in req.query) {
        params.push(`${k}=${req.query[k]}`)
      }
      search_url += params.join("&");
      
      const response = axios.get(search_url, {
        headers: { 
          'Authorization': token
        }
      })
      
      return response;
    })
    .then(payload => {
      return res.json(payload.data)
    }, err =>  res.status(400).json(err))
});
```
* To fetch data from the Spotify Web API, we first use `getAuth()` a function we defined to sent a `POST` request to the `/api/token` Spotify API endpoint, while including the Authorization and Content-Type in the headers of the request.
* After we get back the response with the access token, we chain another request to the `/v1/search` endpoint, including our specified search parameters such as song title.  
* Once we get back the response, we return it as a json object.

Lyric Fetching
```js
useEffect(() => {
  fetchLyrics(props.artist, props.name)
  .then(res => setSongLyrics(res.data.lyrics))
  .catch(err => setError('Sorry, lyrics are not yet available for this song.'))
}, []);
```

* In order to fetch lyrics for a specific song, we passed in the track artist and track name into a fetchLyrics action
* We utilized setState React hooks to save the fetched result
* If no results were found for the fetch, we setErrors state to a custom error message to indicate that the lyrics were not available

Intuitive Search Bar Design
```js
const SearchBar = (props) => {

  const [searchString, setSearch] = useState("");
  const [songList, setSongList] = useState([]);
  const [searching, setSearching] = useState(false);

  const onKeyDown = (e) => {
    if (searchString != "" && e.keyCode === 13) {
      if (searching) {
        setSearching(false);
        setSongList([]);
      } else {
        setSearching(true);
        props.search({ q: searchString, type: "track", limit: 5 })
          .then(res => setSongList(res.data.tracks.items))
          .catch(err => setSongList([]))
      }
    }
  }
  ...
 }
```
* Utilize return key to search
* Search by clicking on search icon
* Clear results by clicking away
* Click on listed song to create a post


Post Patch Route
```js
router.patch("/:id",
    passport.authenticate("jwt", { session: false }),
    (req, res) => {
        Post.findByIdAndUpdate(req.params.id, req.body, { new: true })
            .then(updatedPost => {
                User.findById(updatedPost.author).then( foundUser => {
                    let index;
                    foundUser.posts.forEach((post, idx) => {
                        if (post._id.toString() === updatedPost._id.toString()) {
                            index = idx
                        }
                    })
                    foundUser.posts[index] = updatedPost
                    foundUser.save().then(() => {
                        return res.json({user: foundUser, post: updatedPost})
                    })
                })
            })
            .catch(err => res.status(400).json({ nopostfound: "No post found by that ID" }))
    })
```
* To update a post, we first searched for the post by ID and then also the author that owned the post.
* To ensure the user's post gets saved to the database, we iterated through all of their posts and found the index
* We then updated the post by keying in to the user's posts array and finally called .save() on this user to save 
update our database
